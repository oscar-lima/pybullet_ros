loop_rate:              80.0            # default: 80.0, the frequency at which to step sim in hz
gravity:                -9.81           # default: -9.81, earth gravity in m/s^2
max_effort:             100.0           # default: 100.0, the max force to apply to the model in pos and vel mode

# True = allow pybullet to compute the inertia tensor based on mass and volume of the collision shape
# False = you can provide a more accurate inertia tensor, so inertia will be read then from URDF model
